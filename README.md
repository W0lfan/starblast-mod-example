# Starblast Mod Example, based on documentation.
This document was made by Wolfan. The aim of it is to explain more easier how to code a mod. The [Starblast Documentation](https://starblastio.gamepedia.com/Modding_Tutorial) exists, and it explains in details how to code. However, it does not explain how to code an entire mod. It just gives separated informations. You will see in this example how to make an entire mod, with less explanations and more fun.
I suggest you to install the [SET extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/starblast-enhancement-too/bidhmieomigmdphceifkifanapkgmplc), because that is the extension i use in this tutorial. If you don't install it, you will notice some differences between the normal ship editor and the one i use. The utilities will still looks the same however. 
Let's start coding!


## Let's just make a basic mod!
###### Ship testing!
*Wow!!! I'm so happy! I finally made a ship!! This is so cool!*

*So cool! Can i test it?*

*Yeah of cou.. wait, how can i test my mod? :hyperthonk:*

*You don't know how to do? Let me explain it to you!*

You made your ship and you want to test it? It's really simple!
